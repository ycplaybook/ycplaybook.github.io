                    <p>Pre-Yogi Cup Marketing will be launched the week of Yogi Cup Launch (when player registration opens). Before the Launch, the Marketing team should make a plan regarding how we will encourage (more) kishores to participate in Yogi Cup.</p>
                    <p>Below is a generic plan: feel free to add or change aspects as the team sees fit.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Send weekly emails after registration opens. These emails should be focused on encouraging kishores to register. In the past, these emails have contained:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Yogi Cup Overview (what Yogi Cup is and what’s new about this year’s tournament)</li>
                                <li>Countdown to Yogi Cup (can be a timer or a graphic)</li>
                                <li>Video or GIF of the week</li>
                                <li>Registration Information: deadline and kishore login credentials to BKMS</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Every week registration is open, the Yogi Cup leads and RCTLs call all the kishore coordinators and co-coordinators in the region to push them to register kishores as soon as possible. The Google Sheet used to track these calls in 2020 can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D08PZtiXRwKvcbe59PmMYqifl1qz9HLWUVI2Vk5vN1o/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></li>
                        <li>Every week, a GIF, graphic, or video is sent to the NE Kishores Telegram Channel</li>
                        <li>After player registration closes, the weekly emails should still continue. However, they should now focus more on Yogi Cup. In the past, these emails have contained:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Countdown to Yogi Cup</li>
                                <li>Facility Information: address + fun facts (like the number of courts we will be playing on)</li>
                                <li>Arrival Information: the time by which all kishores are requested to be at Yogi Cup</li>
                                <li>“Things to Bring” graphic (last 2 emails)</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>

                    <h6>Possible Ideas implement in future marketing plans:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Script, shoot, edit, and send out Yogi Cup commercials - similar to the old Shayona commercials</li>
                        <li>Bring back the Yogi Cup Mascot?</li>
                        <li>Have each team make their own “intro” video - a video introducing who they are. Show the best videos in the programs. The Champions’ videos can be shown in the Awards Ceremony</li>
                        <li>Trickshot Challenge</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If you’re new to basketball, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iu-MqDGDEkys8J60Zqd6rT4nDXfc2rQ2/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here’s</a> what a trick shot is (the video is one of a few that the Southwest region sent out for their Trickshot Challenge)</li>
                                <li>Kishore submit their trick shots to a form like <a href="http://tinyurl.com/YC19TRICKSHOT" target="_blank">this</a>, which was used by the Southwest region for their Trickshot Challenge</li>
                                <li>Some of the videos submitted can be sent out in the weekly emails (one per email)</li>
                                <li>The Yogi Cup leads, RCTLs, and RCs can vote on the best trickshot. The winner will receive a prize, such as a Yogi Cup sweater</li>
                                    <ul><li>Note: if we include the prize as part of the competition, make sure to highlight what the prize will be in the weekly emails</li></ul>

                          <ul>
                              <li>Currently, the backdrop on which we hang the banner is very worn down (and a pain to set up!). It take 20 minutes to put everything together + tape edges to prevent it from falling</li>

                  <h5>To determine Playoff Seeding when multiple teams have the same record:</h5>

                        <ol type="a"><li>Teams with a higher point differential are given a higher seed. Note that the point differential for each game is capped at 20.</li></ol>
                      <li>If multiple teams have the same record and same point differentials, rank them according to strength of schedule</li>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>For Yogi Cup purposes, strength of schedule is determined by measuring a team’s opponents’ average winning percentage. This is done by adding up the records of all the opponents a team faced and converting that summed record into a decimal*</li>
                            <li>Example: if a team played 5 teams whose records were 5-0, 4-1, 3-2, 4-1, and 3-2, the team’s opponents’ summed record would be 19-6. When converted to a decimal, the result would be 0.76. The team’s strength of schedule would thus be 0.76*</li>
                        </ol>
                      <li>If multiple teams have the same record, same point differential, and same strength of schedule, rank them according to the number of points they allowed in all their games</li>
                        <ol type="a"><li>Sum the points scored by a team's opponents in all their games. That sum is their “Points Allowed” value. Whichever team has a lower “Points Allowed” value is seeded higher.</li></ol>
                  </ol>

                  <p>*Suggestion: this method of determining strength of schedule is not the best.

                      This <a href="https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics101/relative-percentage-index-rpi/" target="_blank">link</a> also provides a formula that can be used to provide better standings / tiebreakers (it essentially provides the same information as strength of schedule, but in a more comprehensive and robust manner).</p>

                          <ul>
                              <li><strong>2-Pointer</strong>: a shot scored anywhere inside the three-point arc. This includes the paint, midrange and at the rim. For every basket that is a 2-pointer, add 2 points to the offensive team’s score.</li>
                              <li><strong>3-Pointer</strong>: a shot scored anywhere beyond the three-point arc. For every basket that is a 3-pointer, add 3 points to the offensive team’s score.</li>
                              <li><strong>Free Throw</strong>: an unopposed shot scored from behind the free throw line. A free throw usually occurs after a shooting foul or after the defensive team has no fouls to give. For every free throw made, add 1 point to the score of the team that shot the ball.</li>
                          </ul>
                      <li><strong>Assist</strong>: pass that leads directly to a made basket.</li>
                      <li><strong>Rebound</strong>: when a player recovers the ball after a missed shot. This statistic is the number of total rebounds a player has collected on either offense or defense</li>
                      <li><strong>Steal</strong>: when a defensive player takes the ball from a player on offense, causing a turnover</li>
                      <li><strong>Block</strong>: when an offensive player attempts a shot, and the defense player tips the ball, blocking their chance to score</li>
                      <li><strong>Foul</strong>: any type of illegal physical contact. When a foul occurs, the referee will stop play and signal a foul. The scorekeepers are to simply record the number of fouls a team has accumulated over the course of the half</li>

                  <h5>Scoresheet Tasks</h5>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Before every game, scorekeepers must:</li>

                              <li>Fill out the top of the scoresheet (write court number, circle the league, write teams playing, etc.)</li>
                              <li>Write the number of the team for which the scorekeeper is tracking stats (in the “Scoresheet if for Team #” area)</li>
                              <li>Write the names of each of the players on the team of which the scorekeeper is keeping track.</li>
                          </ul>
                      <li>After every game, scorekeepers must:</li>
                          <ul>
                              <li>Circle the winning team on their scoresheet (on both areas indicated)</li>
                              <li>Get the signatures of both team captains</li>
                          </ul>
                      <li>For reference, the scoresheet used in 2020 can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VSzqSQ9nwYShSw9HvLkv9WPFUKHSdbLh/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></li>

                              <li>The captains of both teams have to sign the scoresheets of each scorekeeper</li>
                              <li>Apart from the actual statistics recorded, the rest of the scoresheet should be identical to the scoresheet of the paired scorekeeper</li>
                          </ul>
                      <li>Runners should only take scoresheets from scorekeepers if the scoresheets have been filled out properly</li>
